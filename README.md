## üìä About The Dataset

The model was trained on a custom dataset of videos categorized into two classes: "shoplifters" and "non-shoplifters." The dataset contains a variety of scenarios to ensure the model's robustness. The distribution of frames per video is as follows:

## üß† Model Architecture

The core of this project is a hybrid CNN-RNN model designed for video classification:

-   **CNN Base (MobileNetV2):** A pre-trained MobileNetV2 is used for efficient feature extraction from individual video frames.
-   **TimeDistributed Layer:** This wrapper allows the CNN to process each frame of a video sequence independently.
-   **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) Layer:** A GRU layer processes the sequence of features to capture temporal dependencies and patterns in the video.
-   **Dense Layers:** Fully connected layers at the end classify the video as either containing shoplifting activity or not.

The best-performing model weights are saved in the `best_ShopGuard_model.h5` file.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You will need Python 3.x and the following libraries:

-   TensorFlow
-   OpenCV
-   scikit-learn
-   Matplotlib
-   NumPy

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Usage

All the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation is contained within the **`ShopGuard.ipynb`** Jupyter Notebook.

You can run the notebook in a Jupyter or Google Colab environment to see the entire workflow. The notebook also includes the code to load the pre-trained model (`best_ShopGuard_model.h5`) for inference.

## üìà Results

The model achieves an outstanding accuracy of approximately **99.42%** on the test set. The detailed performance metrics are visualized below.

### Accuracy and Loss History

The training history shows that the model learns effectively, with the validation accuracy tracking the training accuracy closely and the validation loss decreasing consistently.
